/**
 * This hook is responsible for applying Actions that occur on success or failure of an assertion, for example auto-raising and closing incidents
 * that are generated due to an assertion run event.
 *
 * There are a few cases covered by the hook:
 *
 * Case 1: Assertion Success Event.
 *
 *  a) Incidents: When an Assertion passes, this hook will inspect whether the assertion
 *     has been configured to resolve incidents (which were raised by the generator). If yes, then the generator will
 *     auto-close the active incidents related to the assertion. If no, then the generator will skip the assertion.
 *
 *  b) Anomalies: In contract, when an Inferred (system) Assertion passes, any active anomalies that were generated based on a
 *     previous Assertion failure will be resolved.
 *     Note that resolution is different from REVIEW. Anomalies will still be subject to review, even if they are marked in
 *     the resolved state.
 *
 * Case 2: Assertion Failure Event.
 *
 *  a) Incidents: When an Assertion fails, this hook will inspect whether the assertion has
 *     been configured to raise incidents. If yes, then the generator will auto-raise an incident related to this
 *     assertion. If no, then the generator will skip the assertion.
 *
 *  a) Anomalies: When an Inferred (system) Assertion fails, this hook will generate an Anomaly which reflects
 *     what has been detected.
 *     In the future, we intend to add ability to disable anomaly generation for particular assets, or globally.
 *     If there is an active anomaly which has already been generated based on the results of the assertion,
 *     it will simply be updated to reflect the current state.
 *     We will NOT generate duplicate anomalies based on the same inferred assertion.
 *     In the future, we will likely need to prevent new anomalies from being generated if existing anomalies were
 *     manually reviewed / resolved recently. (To prevent a thrashing between Active and Resolved anomalies until the models are
 *     able to update).
 *
 * Case 3: An Assertion is Hard Deleted.
 *
 *  a) Incidents: When an Assertion is deleted, this hook will search for any
 *     active or resolved incidents that were generated by the Assertion. It will then cascade the delete to the incident,
 *     deleting it in it's entirety.
 *
 *  b) Anomalies: When an Inferred Assertion is deleted, this hook will search for any active anomalies that were
 *     generated by the Assertion. It will then cascade the delete to the anomalies, deleting it in it's entirety.
 *
 * Case 4: An Assertion is Soft Deleted.
 *
 *  a) Incidents: When an Assertion is deleted, this hook will search for any
 *      active or resolved incidents that were generated by the Assertion. It will then cascade the delete to the incident,
 *      deleting it in it's entirety.
 *
 *  b) Anomalies: When an Inferred Assertion is deleted, this hook will search for any active anomalies that were
 *     generated by the Assertion. It will then cascade the delete to the anomalies, deleting it in it's entirety.
 *
 * The hook handles restated events by replaying the logic. The hook will ensure that multiple incidents are not
 * generated by the SAME assertion at once (prevents duplicate incidents).
